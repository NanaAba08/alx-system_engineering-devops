  - 🙅‍♂️ 100% of users experienced the digital equivalent of being stranded on a deserted island without their files!

Root Cause:

The mischief-maker behind the chaos? A misconfigured network switch that decided to lead our data on a wild goose chase within the server cluster.

Timeline:

- **09:00 UTC**: The digital sirens blared! Servers went berserk with errors and timeouts, triggering alarms louder than a morning rooster!
- **09:15 UTC**: Like tech detectives, we plunged into system logs, expecting to catch a digital burglar red-handed.
- **10:30 UTC**: Ah, the thrill of the chase! Initially, we thought it might be a digital stampede (DDoS), but turns out it was just a wild goose chase in the logs.
- **11:45 UTC**: Eureka! A closer look at the network switch logs revealed its mischievous settings causing a traffic jam in our data highways.
- **12:15 UTC**: Distress signals sent to the Network Operations team for some tech sorcery to untangle the mess!
- **13:30 UTC**: Victory dance time! Service revived post-switch settings reset and thorough data flow validations.

Root Cause and Resolution:

- Root Cause:
  - The rebellious network switch caused a traffic jam, disrupting the flow of data within our server cluster. It behaved like a prankster disrupting the digital traffic flow!

- Resolution:
  - Our tech wizards saved the day by resetting the switch settings and meticulously testing data paths to ensure a smooth ride.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
