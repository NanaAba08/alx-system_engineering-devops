**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration**: 
  - Start Time: December 15, 2023, 09:00 UTC
  - End Time: December 15, 2023, 13:30 UTC
- **Impact**:
  - The file-sharing service experienced complete downtime for all users for approximately 4.5 hours.
  - 100% of users were affected, leading to an inability to upload, download, or access shared files.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the outage was traced to a misconfigured network switch that caused a disruption in the data flow within the server cluster.

**Timeline:**

- **09:00 UTC**: Issue detected through a spike in error rates and server timeouts, flagged by automated monitoring alerts.
- **09:15 UTC**: Investigation began into the system logs, focusing on recent changes and network configurations.
- **10:30 UTC**: Initially assumed a potential DDoS attack due to unusual traffic patterns, leading to misdirected investigation into network traffic logs.
- **11:45 UTC**: Realized the misconfiguration of a network switch after detailed network diagnostics and switch log analysis.
- **12:15 UTC**: Incident escalated to the Network Operations team for immediate resolution.
- **13:30 UTC**: Service restored after reconfiguring the network switch and validating data flow across the server cluster.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause**:
  - The misconfiguration of a network switch led to a disruption in data flow within the server cluster. The misconfigured switch caused a bottleneck, hindering the transfer of data across critical nodes.

- **Resolution**:
  - The issue was rectified by reconfiguring the network switch settings to their default state. Additionally, thorough testing was conducted to ensure seamless data flow across the server cluster.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes**:
  - Implement stricter change management protocols to prevent misconfigurations in network devices.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to provide early detection of abnormal network behaviors.

- **Tasks to Address**:
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of network device configurations to ensure consistency and accuracy.
  - Update incident response protocols to efficiently handle network-related issues.
  - Schedule regular network audits to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations.

By implementing these measures, we aim to bolster the system's resilience against similar incidents and fortify our network infrastructure for enhanced stability and reliability.
