This is a simple infrastructure with an application server and a web server, each on its own server, along with a load balancer (HAproxy) configured as a cluster. Here are the details and explanations:

*Server 1: Web Server*
- Purpose: This server will be responsible for serving static web content, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Explanation: The web server is added to separate the handling of static content from dynamic content. This improves performance and allows for easier scaling when needed.

*Server 2: Application Server*
- Purpose: This server will run the application code and handle dynamic requests from users.
- Explanation: The application server executes the backend code, interacts with the database, and performs business logic. Separating it from the web server allows for scalability and flexibility.

*Server 3: Database Server (not explicitly mentioned but assumed)*
- Purpose: This server stores and manages the application's data.
- Explanation: The database server is a critical component of most web applications. It stores user data, content, and other information necessary for the application to function.

*Server 4: Load Balancer (HAproxy Cluster)*
- Purpose: This load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple application servers for load distribution and redundancy.
- Explanation: By configuring HAproxy as a cluster, you ensure high availability and load balancing. If one load balancer fails, another can take over, minimizing downtime.

*Explanation of Specifics:*
- Web Server: Separates static content serving from dynamic content for better performance.
- Application Server: Executes dynamic code, handles user requests, and interacts with the database.
- Database Server: Stores application data.
- Load Balancer Cluster: Ensures high availability and load distribution by distributing traffic across multiple application servers.

By separating these components onto individual servers and using HAproxy as a cluster, you create a more robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle increased traffic and provide redundancy in case of server failures. This design enhances performance, reliability, and flexibility for your web application.
